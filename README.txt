- Logger
    - RestaurantLogger
        - Logs configuration information in CONFIG level
        - Logs any errors that occur in WARNING level
        - Logs any inputs that server, cook, manager make in INFO.level
    - BillLogger
        - Keeps track of all paid bills.


menu.txt
===========================================
- this file is used to initialize the menu
- please enter dish in this format:
dishName;cost;firstIngredient:defaultAmount:minAmount:maxAmount,second Ingredient...
- no space in between, except dishName and ingredientName.
- dishName, cost, and ingredient are separated by semicolon
- ingredient, default, allowed subtraction, and allowed addition are separated by colon
- ingredients are separated by comma
- this file will be recreated as an empty file by the program when deleted


starter.txt
===========================================
- this file is used to initialize the program with the number of employees, backend.table, and number of ingredients
- please only enter one integer in the first 4 lines:
    1st number represents the amount of Tables
    2nd number represents the number of Servers
    3rd number represents the number of Cooks
    4th number represents the number of Managers
- each line after fourth line are backend.inventory stock, represented in this format:
    ingredientName,currentAmount,lowerThreshold
- no space after the comma
- all amount are integers
- when the ingredients are below the lowerThreshold, the program will write to request.txt requesting for more backend.inventory
- this file will be recreated as an empty file by the program when deleted


request.txt
===========================================
- it contains all items that the Manager going to order from
- it will be in the following format with a space in between name and amount:
    ingredientName1  amount1
    ingredientName2  amount2
          ...          ...
    ingredientNameN  amountN

- after the request is sent, the manager should manually clear the request.txt
- we are assuming no ingredient is below threshold when the program starts, so if an ingredient is below threshold when the program starts, request.txt wonâ€™t generate a new line

Corner Cases
===========================================
1. runningQuantity is used to determine if a dish is available for order. Since the actual quantity of ingredients in the restaurant are not deducted until after a dish is prepared by the cook and
ready for delivery, we need a separate quantity variable to update the quantity every a dish is added to the order. Thus, the runningQuantity is 'updated' faster than the actual quantity for the
inventory ingredient would be, preventing creation of orders for which there are not enough ingredients left in the inventory.

2. Our program allows a seated table to be cleared even after ordering dishes. This flexibility allows the program to accommodate outlying situations such as where a customer may have ordered dishes
and decided to leave without notifying any of the restaurant employees due to overwhelming delay, or other unforeseen circumstances. We leave it up to the user of the program to ensure that the bill
is printed before clearing the table, since so far there is no way to recall the information of the cleared table and thus it would be impossible to print bills for a table that has been cleared.

3.


1. computerServer delivers dish before the dish is made - This exception will not occur in phase 2 because we will make the Server select the delivered dish from the frontend.GUI, which only gives valid options (i.e. cooked dishes) so that the program will not have NullPointerException
2. invalid employeeID - Warns the user of this error in input and does not call the method to run. This should not exist in phase 2 as input will not be in the form of backend.event.txt, but specified input according to the frontend.GUI
3. note: Our plan for phase 2 is to have the Manager enter the menu and ingredients with frontend.GUI, so all the exceptions caused by parsing the the input from backend.event.txt should not happen.
4. we will implement save data (e.g. backend.inventory) to offline text files in phase 2, since by then the user will be able to close the program properly
